# Cosmos Tracker

This is a TypeScript application that tracks the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) in real-time using data from the NASA Open Notify API. The application displays the current location of the ISS on a map and updates the position in real-time. Additionally, the application allows the user to view additional information, such as the name of the country under which the ISS is currently passing.

## Wave division

The project will be divided into four waves, each with its own objectives and milestones. Below, we describe each of the waves in detail:

### Wave 1: Integration of the Open Notify API

- Development environment setup
- Obtain an API key from Open Notify

### Wave 2: Implementing the ISS tracker

- Display the current location of the ISS on a map
- Update the ISS position in real-time
- Add a search feature to locate the ISS at a specific date and time

### Wave 3: Adding additional features

- Display the name of the country under which the ISS is currently passing
- Add a notification feature to alert the user when the ISS is passing over their location
- Allow the user to view the ISS trajectory over the last 24 hours

### Wave 4: Testing and deployment

- Write unit tests to ensure the application works correctly
- Deploy the application to a hosting service, such as Heroku or AWS
- Ensure the application is accessible and performs well on different devices and browsers
